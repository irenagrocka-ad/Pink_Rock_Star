                <p>
                  I think of you when I think about forever<br />
                  I hear a joke and I know you would've told it better<br />
                  I think of you out of the blue when I'm watching a movie that you'd hate<br />
                  You'd say it, you were never one to hesitate<br />
                  You were always first in line, so why would it be different for Heaven?<br />
                  But I got a couple questions<br />

                  [Chorus]<br/>
                  Is there a bar up there where you've got a favorite chair?<br />
                  Where you sit with friends and talk about the wеather?<br />
                  Is there a placе you go to watch the sunset?<br />
                  And, oh, is there a song you just can't wait to share..<br />
